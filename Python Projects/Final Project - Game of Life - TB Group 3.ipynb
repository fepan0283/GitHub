    "# fields. Second, we created an action field for every field that the players arrive on, triggering some kind of event that \n",
    "# impacts their money balance, job, or education (e.g. \"You play lotto. You win 10.000 EUR\"). Third, we created some decision\n",
    "# fields where the player interacts with code. Decisions affect the following fields and the outcome of the game. Lastly, we \n",
    "# created some functions like the selection of number of players and name creation. \n",
    "# In the end a winner is determined depending on the final balance of the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The following section contains the activities that are called up as soon as a player \n",
    "# moves to the corresponding field.\n",
    "# Each field is stored in the dictionary 'field_dic'. The key of each field is the associated \n",
